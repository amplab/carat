        <h3>Mitä tarkoittaa "Muistinkäyttö/Aktiivisena"?</h3>
        <p>The operating system (OS) classifies your device's physical memory as either <i>used</i> or <i>free</i>. If memory is used, it means there is currently data there that belongs to some process (like one of your apps or the OS, itself). When the device runs out of free memory, it needs to make room so it can store new data, which means closing apps that might be running in the background or asking your apps to throw away data they aren't using.</p>
        <p>The OS then further subcategorizes used memory as being either <i>active</i> or <i>inactive</i>, depending on whether it was accessed recently or not, respectively. When the OS runs out of free memory, it starts reclaiming inactive memory.</p>
        <p>When you open a bunch of apps, the fraction of used memory may increase; when the apps you have running are working with lots of data (often an energy-intensive task), the fraction of active memory may increase. The OS also preloads often used applications into memory, shortening wait times.</p>
