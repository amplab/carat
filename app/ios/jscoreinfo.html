        <h3>What is a J-Score?</h3>
        <p>The J-Score represents the percentile battery life you see relative to all other devices being measured by Carat. So, if you have a J-Score of 50, that means your expected battery life is better than half of our users; a score of 99 means you have better battery life than 99% of our users.</p>

        <p>Of course, a single number does not provide a complete description of your battery life. A low J-Score could mean that your device is using a big battery inefficiently or a small battery with average efficiency. Similarly, a high J-Score could simply mean that you don't use your device heavily. Carat computes a huge variety of statistics, and the J-Score is just one of them.</p>
