        <h3>Carat: collaborative detection of energy bugs</h3>
        <p>Carat is a research project from the AMP Lab at UC Berkeley that helps detect and diagnose battery problems. After collecting data about your device for <b><i>a week or more</i></b>, it will give you personalized recommendations. The app uses <b><i>a low-power feature of Location Services</i></b> to be notified of significant changes in your location and to take samples. Carat does <b><i>NOT</i></b> use GPS or run in the background, period. If your battery is running down quickly, it isn't Carat's fault, but we hope it will help you discover the real culprit.<p>
        <p>The <b><i>Actions</i></b> list tells you how to make <i>your</i> battery last longer and how much improvement to expect.<p>
        <p><b><i>Bugs</i></b> are apps that use a lot of energy on a small number of devices, including yours. Restarting a buggy app may improve battery life.<p>
        <p><b><i>Hogs</i></b> are apps that are correlated with higher energy use across many devices. Closing hogs may improve battery life.<p>
        <p>Carat collects and reports generic usage statistics about your phone that allow it to do its job; this process involves absolutely no personally identifying information. Period.<p>
        <p>Carat is under development, so please check back often to see new results. The more you use it, the better it will get.
